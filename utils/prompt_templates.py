                                        - If asking about all professors (e.g., "List all professors", "Who teaches in CSE?"), use the base URL without parameters: "http://localhost:8000/cse/professor"
                                    
                                    When using these APIs, you must generate the appropriate API URL with the correct parameters.

                                    If a required parameter is missing, please ask the user to provide it.
                                    If an optional parameter is mentioned in the query, include it in your API URL.
                                    
                                    Always extract all mentioned parameters to provide the most relevant information.
